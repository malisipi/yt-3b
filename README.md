## FAQ

### Why named as YT|3B?

> The reason of that is first design idea. Firstly, it designed block adblocker warnings. However, later, it was changed to an anblock. 3B name is coming from `Block adBlocker Blocker`.

### What changed?

> YT was improved their AD system. So the extension was affected badly. So I was turned it an adblock since it's easier than breaking AD system.

* After `0.1.0`, it's an adblock.
* `0.1.0` and before `0.1.0`, it's a helper to use YT with adblock without useless warnings.
